# surface-luminance-coding-in-V1
# This repository contains dataset and codes are for the current paper under review in Nature Communication on surface luminance coding. The figures' data is available in this file. All the data is saved as the format of the excel so that you can easily read. The main and supplementary figures in the paper could be reploted using these data under the matlab script (eg. mean.m, std.m, ttest.m, correcoef.m). Codes for luminance decoding model and signal transmission model are also provided for the extension of the current work.

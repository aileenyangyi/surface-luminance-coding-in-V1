# surface-luminance-coding-in-V1
# This repository contains dataset and codes for the current paper under review in Nature Communication on surface luminance coding. The figures' data is available in the file 'NCOMMS-21-11016A-source-data'. All the data is saved as the format of the excel so that you can easily read. The main and supplementary figures in the paper could be reploted using these data under the matlab script (eg. mean.m, std.m, ttest.m, correcoef.m). 
# ‘group_code_1’ is related to figure 1 and supplementary figures 1 and 2
# ‘group_code_2’ is related to figure 2 and supplementary figures 3 and 4
# ‘group_code_3’ is related to figure 3 and supplementary figures 10 and 11
# ‘group_code_4’ is related to figure 4 and supplementary figures 5 and 6
# ‘group_code_5’ is related to figure 5 
# ‘group_code_6’ is related to figure 6 and supplementary figures 8,9 and 12
# ‘group_code_7’ is related to figure 7 

# Codes for luminance decoding model and signal transmission model are also provided for the extension of the current work.
